## Performance
The model performed with 74% accuracy on the dataset without any data augmentation. On flipping the image horizontally and adjusting the contrast the model showed only mild improvement, whereas 
on increasing the brightness and flipping the image reduced performance. Flipping the image horizontal and vertically, only improved performance by a small margin.
